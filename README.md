# **QR Code Generator**

This is a simple React-based web application that generates customizable QR codes. Users can input a URL, select a color for the QR code, and generate it. The application also allows users to quickly generate a default black-and-white QR code, download the generated QR code as an image, or copy it to the clipboard.

## **Features**

- Input a URL to generate a QR code.
- Select different colors for the QR code (white, yellow, red, green, blue) with a black background.

## **Code Overview**

The main component is `QrCodeGenerator`, which:

- Manages the input for the URL (`url`) and color (`color`) using the `useState` hook.
- Uses the `qrcode` library to generate a QR code on a `<canvas>` element.
- Provides functions for generating QR codes, downloading them, and copying them to the clipboard.

### **Key Functions**

- `generateQRCode()`: Generates a custom QR code based on the URL and selected color.
- `quickGenerate()`: Quickly generates a black-and-white QR code.
- `downloadQRCode()`: Allows the user to download the QR code as a `.png` image.
- `copyQRCode()`: Copies the generated QR code image to the clipboard.
- `reset()`: Resets the form and canvas.

## **Potential Future Enhancements**

- **Error Handling**: Improve the UX by providing clearer feedback on invalid URLs.
- **Customization**: Allow more customization options such as setting different background colors or adjusting the size of the QR code.
- **History**: Implement a feature to save previously generated QR codes.
